<p align="center"><strong>The Future of BSD System.</strong><br>
A Unix-like experience, reimagined for modern users.</p>

## 🧠 What is VelocityOS?

**VelocityOS** is a modern, modular, and minimal operating system based on the BSD architecture — redesigned from the ground up for better performance, cleaner structure, and superior user experience.

Forget bloated Linux distros. Forget vendor lock-in.
VelocityOS gives you the speed of BSD, with the polish of macOS, and the clarity of doing things *right*.

> “Built by devs. Loved by machines.”

## 🔧 Key Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [VeloBSD](https://github.com/ProjectVelo/velobsd) | Forked from FreeBSD. Restructured for clarity. Minimalist, modular, and Velo-core'd. |
| [vlaunch](https://github.com/ProjectVelo/vlaunch) | Lightweight .app bundle launcher daemon for VelocityOS. Think `launchd`, but BSD-style. |
| [libswipe](https://github.com/ProjectVelo/libswipe) | UI toolkit designed for VelocityOS apps — fast, smooth, and fully native. |

## 💡 Philosophy

- **Minimal, but not barebones** — Clear structure, no symlink maze.
- **Consistent userland** — `/userland` instead of `/usr`, for sanity.
- **Installer without ISO** — `.txz` package-based system deployment.
- **.app bundles, .ext libraries** — Just like macOS, but open and BSD-native.
- **No nonsense. Just control.**
